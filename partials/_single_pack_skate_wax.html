						<h2 class="size-28 font-weight-black uppercase">HOW TO USE SKATE WAX?</h2><br>
							<p class="size-20">Apply small amount of JWAX skate wax on the curb, ledge or rails which you want to grind or slide. You will need more wax if they are virgin or rough. Our skate wax performance does not depend on the environment temperatures however you could press harder when waxing in temperatures close to zero and apply light pressure when waxing in hot weather. IMPORTANT: Be careful with inclined or kink rails as they may get TOO FAST.
								Another option to use the skateboard wax is to apply a small amount under your board or scooter. But we would advise to use this method only in skateparks.
