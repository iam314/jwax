							<h3>How to use surf wax?</h3><br>
								<p>Top up your surfboard with desired amount of JWAX surf wax every time you get on your board until you get that grip. However one quick fix waxing should last at least a couple of sessions depending on the water temperature. On yearly base You should remove the old wax from your surfboard and rub a new surf wax around every 3-4 months. In warm waters this procedure may repeat more often. Just rub on and we will do the rest.

							<h3>When to use surf wax?</h3><br>
