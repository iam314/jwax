					<p class="black size-24">
						You can always use candles оr other substitutes and alternatives when you run out of wax but they will not bring you the desired result. We at JWAX truly advise using a professionally developed <a href="double_pack_skate_wax.html" class="links">skate wax</a> to get those smooth and stylish grinds with ease.

					<h3 class="size-28 font-weight-black uppercase">Skate wax vs snow wax vs surf wax?</h3><br>
					<p class="black size-24">	Can I use skate wax instead of surf or snow wax? NO. Simple as that. <a href="single_pack_skate_wax.html" class="links">Skate wax</a> is for skating, <a href="single_pack_snow_wax.html" class="links">snow wax</a> is for skiing and snowboarding and <a href="single_pack_surf_wax.html" class="links">surf wax</a> is for surfing the waves. Different mixtures, different purposes.

					<h3 class="size-28 font-weight-black uppercase">Can I use skate wax in the skatepark?</h3><br>
					<p class="black size-24">Some skateparks have special politics regarding the usage of skating waxes on their territory. Make sure to check if you are allowed to use skate wax in the skatepark and where exactly. Also, let the other riders in the park know that you have waxed a specific spot in the skate park to prevent incidents. Some skaters and riders use very hard wheels which became super slippy when in contact with the wax. Let’s set a wax etiquette, show respect and have fun.
