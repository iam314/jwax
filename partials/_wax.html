						Hand crafted wax for skate, snow and surf. Manufactured by five friends in a basement in downtown Sofia, Bulgaria.
						We are fortunate to have locations for skating, snowboarding and surfing all within a few hours drive, which gives us the perfect testing grounds to experiment with our products.
						Do that curb or rail grind with ease. Don't get stuck with your ski or snowboard in the flat snow. Stop slipping off your surfboard.
						Developed by riders, trusted by hundreds, JWAX gives you all that.
						No matter if you are skateboarding, rollerblading, riding a scoot or BMX, surfing, snowboarding or skiing
						JWAX is the essential wax to have fun.
						Grab some wax and shred like you've never shred before.
