				<p class="black size-24">
					Picture this: a band of shredders chillin' in a basement in Sofia, Bulgaria, having laughs and suddenly coming up with the idea of a game-changer that lets them own every skate sesh, killing the snow parks, and ruling the waves. That my Gâ€™s, is how JWAX was born! We crafted an epic piece of art-shaped wax that has been changing the game for riders everywhere since day one.

					What about our off-the-wall epic mission? 
					See, we're not just about crafting that dope wax but we're about breaking down barriers and merging lanes. Skateboarders, rollerbladers, BMX riders, freestyle scooter guys, snow chasers, and wave riders â€“ we're here to bring all you legends together.
					To us, it doesn't matter what sport you're into, it's all about the ride. Whether skating the urban jungle, hitting the snowy peaks, or catching the biggest wave, it's the rush, the freedom, and the sheer joy that tie us all together.
					So, our mission? To unite all riders under one gnarly banner: 
					The love of the ride.

				<p class="black size-24">
					Well, it ain't just for fun and the rad times. Sometimes shit happens. When you shred with JWAX, you're not only leveling up your game â€“ you're helping us kick cancer's butt and change lives, one ride at a time. Now, that's the sickest way to make your mark on this world, don't you think? Together, we'll ride for the cause and fight breast cancer like the badass champs we are.
