						<p>
							<a href="https://jwax.wtf" class="links">jwax.wtf</a> takes the protection of your personal data very seriously. We want you to know which data we store, when and how we use it. We have taken technical and organizational measures to ensure that we and our service providers comply with the data protection regulations. Further development of our website and the implementation of new technology to improve our services may result in changes to this privacy policy. We therefore recommend that you reread this privacy policy at regular intervals.<br><br>
							This privacy policy (together with our website Terms of Use)  sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us when you use <a href="https://jwax.wtf" class="links">jwax.wtf</a> or when you engage with us in some other form.<br><br>

							4.1. When you access our websites, we may collect information about your computer including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration.

							6.2. If you decide to share your information with us through e-mail or our websites, you must be aware that our e-mail and website are encrypted using SSL technology and provide secure data transmissions. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via other channels such as social media networks (e.g. Facebook, Instagram etc.) is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us. Any such transmission is at your own risk, so we strongly advise you to use our official website and e—mail for any communication and sharing your personal information.<br><br>
							6.3. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access and keep the information secure, confidential and integral.<br><br>
							We store all the documents and other devices containing personal data in secured storages in our premises with limited access, especially the data which contains “sensitive” information.

							<strong>7. Protection of minors</strong><br>
							Persons under the age of 18 years should not transfer any personal data to us without the consent of their parents or guardian. We do not request personal data from children and teenagers. We do not consciously collect any such data or transfer it to third parties.<br><br>
							<strong>8. For how long do we keep your personal data ?</strong><br><br>

							8.2. In general, we hold your information for 7 years after your last contact/correspondence in case of complaints or legal claims.<br><br>
							8.3.  Where we have been using your personal data to provide you with marketing, we will retain this information for 7 years and we will delete immediately your personal data following your request to be removed from our marketing list.<br><br>

							9.1.
